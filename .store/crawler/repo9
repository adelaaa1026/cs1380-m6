I was using multiple apps to try and stay on track with my studies, and I thought to myself, why is there no singular app that can do everything a student needs to stay on track with their studies? Like a GitHub but for students.\n\n## Planned MVP Features\n\n- ‚úçÔ∏è Note Taking\n- üìö Flashcards\n\nThe flashcards will be generated from the notes that you take, and you will be able to quiz yourself on them.\n\n## Future Features\n\n- üìÖ Calendar\n- üìù Task management\n- üìä Grade tracking\n\nFeel free to suggest more features by opening an issue, or join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ewKmQd8kYm) to discuss it with the community.\n\n## Star History\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=noodle-run/noodle#gh-light-mode-only)](https://star-history.com/#noodle-run/noodle#gh-light-mode-only)\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=noodle-run/noodle&theme=dark#gh-dark-mode-only)](https://star-history.com/#noodle-run/noodle#gh-dark-mode-only)\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you would like to contribute to Noodle, please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file to get started.\n\n## License\n\nNoodle is open source and available under the [AGPL-3.0-or-later](./LICENSE) license.\n"},"repo_name":{"type":"string","value":"noodle"},"author":{"type":"string","value":"noodle-run"},"topics":{"type":"array","id":1,"value":[{"type":"string","value":"drizzle-orm"},{"type":"string","value":"education"},{"type":"string","value":"eslint"},{"type":"string","value":"javascript"},{"type":"string","value":"next"},{"type":"string","value":"nextjs13"},{"type":"string","value":"prettier"},{"type":"string","value":"productivity-tool"},{"type":"string","value":"react"},{"type":"string","value":"redis"},{"type":"string","value":"sqlite"},{"type":"string","value":"tailwindcss"},{"type":"string","value":"trpc"},{"type":"string","value":"turso"},{"type":"string","value":"typescript"},{"type":"string","value":"upstash"}]},"language":{"type":"string","value":"TypeScript"},"stargazers_count":{"type":"number","value":"12390"},"forks_count":{"type":"number","value":"798"}}}
