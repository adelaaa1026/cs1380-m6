Flutter works with existing\ncode, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and\nopen source.\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/get-started/)\n* [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)\n* [Development wiki](./docs/README.md)\n* [Contributing to Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nFor announcements about new releases, follow the\n[flutter-announce@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flutter-announce)\nmailing list. Our documentation also tracks [breaking\nchanges](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes) across releases.\n\n## Terms of service\n\nThe Flutter tool may occasionally download resources from Google servers. By\ndownloading or using the Flutter SDK, you agree to the Google Terms of Service:\nhttps://policies.google.com/terms\n\nFor example, when installed from GitHub (as opposed to from a prepackaged\narchive), the Flutter tool will download the Dart SDK from Google servers\nimmediately when first run, as it is used to execute the `flutter` tool itself.\nThis will also occur when Flutter is upgraded (e.g. by running the `flutter\nupgrade` command).\n\n## About Flutter\n\nWe think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive,\nextensible and open development model, whether you're targeting iOS or Android,\nweb, Windows, macOS, Linux or embedding it as the UI toolkit for a platform of\nyour choice.\n\n### Beautiful user experiences\n\nWe want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being\nforced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.\nFlutter's [layered architecture] gives you control over every pixel on the\nscreen and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate\ngraphics, video, text, and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full\n[set of widgets][widget catalog] that deliver pixel-perfect experiences whether\nyou're building for iOS ([Cupertino]) or other platforms ([Material]), along with\nsupport for customizing or creating entirely new visual components.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/homepage/reflectly-hero-600px.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Reflectly hero image\"></p>\n\n### Fast results\n\nFlutter is fast. It's powered by hardware-accelerated 2D graphics\nlibraries like [Skia] (which underpins Chrome and Android) and\n[Impeller]. We architected Flutter to\nsupport glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device.\n\nFlutter code is powered by the world-class [Dart platform], which enables\ncompilation to 32-bit and 64-bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android,\nJavaScript and WebAssembly for the web, as well as Intel x64 and ARM\nfor desktop devices.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/homepage/dart-diagram-small.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Dart diagram\"></p>\n\n### Productive development\n\nFlutter offers [stateful hot reload][Hot reload], allowing you to make changes to your code\nand see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.\n\n[![Hot reload animation][]][Hot reload]\n\n### Extensible and open model\n\nFlutter works with any development tool (or none at all), and also includes\neditor plug-ins for both [Visual Studio Code] and [IntelliJ / Android Studio].\nFlutter provides [tens of thousands of packages][Flutter packages] to speed your\ndevelopment, regardless of your target platform. And accessing other native code\nis easy, with support for both FFI ([on Android][Android FFI], [on iOS][iOS FFI],\n[on macOS][macOS FFI], and [on Windows][Windows FFI]) as well as\n[platform-specific APIs][platform channels].\n\nFlutter is a fully open-source project, and we welcome contributions.\nInformation on how to get started can be found in our\n[contributor guide](CONTRIBUT...
