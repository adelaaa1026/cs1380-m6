You are also welcome to make pull requests for changes to the configuration files.\n\n`languages.yml` determines which file extensions are considered part of the same language. (For example, identifiers from `.c` files will be suggested in `.h` files.)\n\n`language_tokenization.json` determines how languages are tokenized.
