This guide works with Tailwind v4.\n\n1. Install Flowbite as a dependency using NPM by running the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install flowbite\n```\n\n2. Import Flowbite as a plugin inside your main Tailwind CSS file:\n\n```javascript\n@plugin \"flowbite/plugin\";\n```\n\n3. Make sure that you add the Flowbite JS source files to your CSS file:\n\n```bash\n@source \"../node_modules/flowbite\";\n```\n\n4. Include the JavaScript code that powers the interactive elements before the end of your `<body>` tag:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"../path/to/flowbite/dist/flowbite.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nLearn more about the Flowbite JavaScript API and functionalities in the [JavaScript section](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/javascript/).\n\nIf you have and old project with Tailwind CSS v3 then [check out this guide](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/#tailwind-css-v3-to-v4) to learn how to upgrade to v4.\n\n### Include using CDN\n\nThe quickest way to get started working with Flowbite is to include the CSS and JS into your project via CDN.\n\nRequire the following minified stylesheet inside the `head` tag:\n\n```html\n<link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@{{< current_version >}}/dist/flowbite.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n```\n\nAnd include the following JavaScript file before the end of the `body` element:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@{{< current_version >}}/dist/flowbite.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nPlease remember that the best way to work with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite is by purging the CSS classes.\n\n### Bundled JavaScript\n\nOne of the most popular way of using Flowbite is to include the bundled Javascript file which is UMD ready using a bundler such as Webpack or Parcel which makes sure that all of the data attributes and functionality will work out-of-the-box.\n\nYou can directly import the main JavaScript file inside your bundled `app-bundle.js` file like this:\n\n```javascript\nimport 'flowbite';\n```\n\nThis file has access to all of the components and it automatically applies event listeners to the data attributes.\n\n### Data attributes\n\nThe preferred way to use the interactive UI components from Flowbite is via the data attributes interface which allows us to add functionality via the HTML element attributes and most of the examples on our documentation applies this strategy.\n\nFor example, to set up a modal component all you need to do is use `data-modal-target` and `data-modal-{toggle|show|hide}` to toggle, show, or hide the component by clicking on any trigger element.\n\n```html\n<button data-modal-target=\"defaultModal\" data-modal-toggle=\"defaultModal\" class=\"block text-white bg-blue-700 hover:bg-blu...
